# agile-project

**Trello(ish)**

By Emily Freeman, Natalie Poppe, and Alex Rodgers

This project was conceptualized, built, and deployed in one month for the part-time program at Parsity Coding School. The goal was to mimic the functionality of Trello, whilst learning how to collaborate in an agile environment.

Trello(ish) is built with React/Redux on the front-end and Node/Express/Mongo on the back-end.
